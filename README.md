# TODO
Work in Progress:

The ongoing project involves the development of an application with the primary function of automating the logging of job applications and dynamically updating the application list based on incoming emails.

Planned Technical Implementation:

Integration of Microsoft Graph API: In the forthcoming development phase, the application will incorporate Microsoft Graph API to enable seamless access to Outlook emails. This integration will facilitate the automated retrieval of job application-related emails, allowing for real-time updates to the application list within the system.

Graphical User Interface (GUI) Implementation: Concurrently, the project roadmap includes the implementation of a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user interaction and streamline the application's usability. The GUI will provide intuitive controls and visual representations for users to navigate through the application and manage job application data efficiently.

Overall, the technical approach entails leveraging Microsoft Graph API to enable email integration, thus automating job application tracking, while also focusing on the development of a user-friendly GUI for optimal user experience.
